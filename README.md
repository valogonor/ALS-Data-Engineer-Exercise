# ALS-Data-Engineer-Exercise
The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate your level of skill when it comes to manipulating and
aggregating a large dataset through code. We’ll evaluate the quality, output and readability of
your code as well as the efficacy of provided documentation.

We recommend using Python and Pandas to complete this exercise. Most of our production
data engineering work is done using Python, Pandas and PySpark (a “big data” alternative to
Pandas).

We recommend submitting your code by way of a personal GitHub repository. Directly
submitting code files is also acceptable.

Draft documentation describing how a reviewer can run your app locally. Be sure to include
steps like installing dependencies or other “pre-flight” configurations necessary for your code to
run.
